This repository demonstrates a common Docker build error and its solution. The initial Dockerfile attempts to copy a requirements.txt file that does not exist in the context. The corrected Dockerfile ensures the file is included before the COPY instruction is executed.  This scenario commonly happens when developers forget to include files necessary for the build process.
